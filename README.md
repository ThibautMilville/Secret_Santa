<h2>Configuration :</h2>
To make the send email function work, you need to configure the SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable.
To configure it on a local environment, use the following command :
setx SENDGRID_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"<br><br>
You also need to configure the sender email in the "constants" file. You can find it in the "config" folder.
